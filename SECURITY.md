## Reporting a Vulnerability

### There are two ways to report a vulnerability.

1. Open a New Issue
2. Contact me on Discord or Instagram. (links on my profile bio)

## What to use and when?

It all depends on the seriousness of the issue. If it's small, report it in the `Issues` page with the label `Security`. You can pull request if you managed to fix the vulnerability. But if the issue is really concerning, then I'll prefer to be sent a dm first. My socials and discord can be found in my profile bio.

### Thanks for showing interest in Aura Text. It means a lot.
